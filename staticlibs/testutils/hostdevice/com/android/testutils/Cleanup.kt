/**
 * Utility to do cleanup in tests without replacing exceptions with those from a finally block.
 *
 * This utility is meant for tests that want to do cleanup after they execute their test
 * logic, whether the test fails (and throws) or not.
 *
 * The usual way of doing this is to have a try{}finally{} block and put cleanup in finally{}.
 * However, if any code in finally{} throws, the exception thrown in finally{} is thrown before
 * any thrown in try{} ; that means errors reported from tests are from finally{} even if they
 * have been caused by errors in try{}. This is unhelpful in tests, because it results in a
 * stacktrace for a symptom rather than a stacktrace for a cause.
 *
 * To alleviate this, tests are encouraged to make sure the code in finally{} can't throw, or
 * that the code in try{} can't cause it to fail. This is not always realistic ; not only does
 * it require the developer thinks about complex interactions of code, test code often relies
 * on bricks provided by other teams, not controlled by the team writing the test, which may
 * start throwing with an update (see b/198998862 for an example).
 *
 * This utility allows a different approach : it offers a new construct, tryTest{}cleanup{} similar
 * to try{}finally{}, but that will always throw the first exception that happens. In other words,
 * if only tryTest{} throws or only cleanup{} throws, that exception will be thrown, but contrary
 * to the standard try{}finally{}, if both throws, the construct throws the exception that happened
 * in tryTest{} rather than the one that happened in cleanup{}.
 *
 * Kotlin usage is as try{}finally{}, but with multiple finally{} blocks :
 * tryTest {
 *   testing code
 * } cleanupStep {
 *   cleanup code 1
 * } cleanupStep {
 *   cleanup code 2
 * } cleanup {
 *   cleanup code 3
 * }
 * Catch blocks can be added with the following syntax :
 * tryTest {
 *   testing code
 * }.catch<ExceptionType> { it ->
 *   do something to it
 * }
 *
 * Java doesn't allow this kind of syntax, so instead a function taking lambdas is provided.
 * testAndCleanup(() -> {
 *   testing code
 * }, () -> {
 *   cleanup code 1
 * }, () -> {
 *   cleanup code 2
 * });
